C#

R

Why These Languages?
--------------------
I limit myself in the interest of time. 
I prioritize these languages because of a mix
of popularity and staying power in the field. 
The C Family, JavaScript/TypeScript, Ruby, and Java covers
most WebDev needs. F# to throw in some functional
programming. R and Python for for most data jockey needs.
There are other languages on the list that also fit those
criteria and their omitted as personal taste preference
(viz. CoffeeScript).
